Welcome to üê±‚Äçüêâ Dino's Looping Challenge of Doom!
You will need to create 4 loops for this challenge

1. Create a loop that writes "I love homework" 5 times
2. Create a loop that counts from 0 to 4 and writes the current number on the screen.
3. Create a loop that counts from 15 to 30 but only writes multiples of 3 on the screen
      - ex. 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30
4. Create a loop that will draw 4X4 square using ‚¨ú. ONLY PRINT 1 ‚¨ú at a time. Your loops should do the rest. It should look like this:
‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú
document.write("‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú") (X) <-- don't do this)
HINT: Loops can be nested inside another loop

5. Dino is a very neat and organized dinosaur. He likes to stack the bones (ü¶¥) of his victims in a nice triangle shape. Create a stack that is 7 bones high.
- You will need to create a loop writes 1 ü¶¥, and every successive line adds one more bone. It should look like this: 

ü¶¥
ü¶¥ü¶¥
ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥
ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥
ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ 
ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥
ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥

6. Create the same pile of bones as challenge 5, but this time, center them by adding a ~ in front so the shape is a pyramid

7. Create a loop that creates 5 stacks of bones, each with another row at the bottom
